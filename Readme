# 🩺 Telemedicine Web App for Rural India

A real-time, WebRTC-powered telemedicine platform designed to bridge the healthcare access gap in India's villages by enabling doctor consultations via video calls between city hospitals and rural clinics.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Many Indian villages lack proper doctors or hospitals. Patients often travel miles to nearby towns even for basic treatment. This app enables a government-linked rural clinic (with internet & webcam) to connect patients with real doctors in city hospitals remotely.
